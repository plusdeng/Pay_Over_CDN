Pay Over CDN is a project that initiated by HXCO. 

It's mainly for merging the most popular mobile payments in China. Using global CDN to ensure 100% uptime and fastest access speed. 

The source code was from <a href="https://mkblog.cn">MKBlog</a>. 
  - We use this project for profitable purposes, but it's mainly on the CDN feature. The source code are still open for everyone and open source with MIT lisence. Everyone who have a domain and a server can deploy the source code on their own.
  - We use jsDelivr to distribute static files.

# New Features!

  - Fully global CDN (Content Delivery Network) support (Pro plans only).
  - Fully https and SRI support to ensure the payment safety.
  - Optimized code in order to reduce the server load.（Maximum 97.86% off）
  
# Security
- As a payment tool, we considered its security for you.
- We're fully supporting HTTPS; All of the resources will be loaded via HTTPS Protocol. As long as your server support HTTPS, we can provide the safest connection to ensure no one can reach your payment information.
- As an extra precaution, you can enable SRI for your QR Code Program. Subresource Integrity (SRI) is a security feature that enables browsers to verify that files they fetch (for example, from a CDN) are delivered without unexpected manipulation. It works by allowing you to provide a cryptographic hash that a fetched file must match.
- If you're ours customer, HTTPS will be default, and SRI will be advanced options. We use a global CDN to deliver your qr-code. There's a Github Repo behind our reliable CDN which is fully private and only visable for our stuffs. Therefore we're able to garantee you a high availability of your qr-code.
